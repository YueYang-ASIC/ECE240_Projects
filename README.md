# ECE240_Projects

***IMPORTANT: When pulling new libaries, the cds.lib file will need to be updated manually as it is unique for each machine.***


Project #1
Due on 02/21/2025

 Question: Design an 8-bit Ripple Carry adder in Verilog and verify its functionality in Modelsim.  Then import it to Synopsys and justify power, area consumption and speed. Also Complete the physical design for the 8-bit Ripple Carry adder in Cadence Innovus. 

Write a report to discuss the objectives, background, process, result and analysis. 
Include all references and your code. Follow the format of the “ECE lab report guidance”. 

This is a group assignment.

Project #2
Due on 03/17/25

Use Cadence Virtuoso to create schematics and layouts for 14T and 6T adders. Resize the transistors in order to optimize the adders and compare in terms of speed and power. Perform post-layout simulations to analyze performance. 

Write a report to discuss the objectives, background, process, results and analysis.
Include all refrences and your code. Follow the format of the "ECE lab report guidance".

This is a group assignment.

Project #3
Due on 04/25/2025

Use Synopsys DC Compiler and Cadence Innovus to complete the physical design layout and complete the Clock Tree Synthesis and Timing analysis post & Pre-Routing. 
FPU_Main.v file is top module file and remaining modules are getting called in top module. So Follow the Steps mentioned in Tutorial document’s.

Using Tutorial document available on canvas complete the synthesis on Synopsys DC Compiler, once synthesis completed Netlist file be generated with extension of .vg. Use the Innovus tutorial File to complete physical design layout. 

Note: Please go through tutorial files step by step and don’t miss any step mainly Innovus Tutorial File.
Write a report to discuss the objectives, background, process, result and analysis. Include all references. Follow the format of the “ECE lab report guidance”.

This is a group assignment.
