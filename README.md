Project #1
Due on 02/21/2025

 Question: Design an 8-bit Ripple Carry adder in Verilog and verify its functionality in Modelsim.  Then import it to Synopsys and justify power, area consumption and speed. Also Complete the physical design for the 8-bit Ripple Carry adder in Cadence Innovus. 

Write a report to discuss the objectives, background, process, result and analysis. 
Include all references and your code. Follow the format of the “ECE lab report guidance”. 

This is a group assignment.

Project #2
Due on 03/17/25

Use Cadence Virtuoso to create schematics and layouts for 14T and 6T adders. Resize the transistors in order to optimize the adders and compare in terms of speed and power. Perform post-layout simulations to analyze performance. 

Write a report to discuss the objectives, background, process, results and analysis.
Include all refrences and your code. Follow the format of the "ECE lab report guidance".
